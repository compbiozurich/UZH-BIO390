## {{page.title}}

This page indicates some of the learning goals, as emphasised by the different lecturers. Some points will have been discussed in different lectures; accordingly, exam questions may not refer to information of one specific presentation.

__Cave__: Please be aware that some of the "Learning Goals" may reflect aspects not necessarily captured by the lectures in the current semester - The ones reelevant for the current semester's exam are related to the given lectures. Also, updates may occurr at any time.

#### Bioinformatics: Definition & Concepts

* definition of "Bioinformatics" (cf. Anna Tramontano)
* categories of informatics tools used in bioinformatics
* hypothesis versus data driven science
* areas of bioinformatics/bioinformaticians, (in contrast to "pure" modelling, statistics etc.)
* 3 main categories of biological data, and example resources
* definition of API
* common sequence related file formats
* hierarchies and relationships as 2 main principles of ontologies
* areas of "not-bioinformatics", and why
* bioinformatics tools (programming languages, libraries, online resources) and their specific use cases

#### Bioinformatics tools & resources

* common programming/analysis languages in bioinformatics and their preferred use
* components of bioinformatics online resources

#### Sequence Analysis

* substitution matrices
* BLAST

#### Statistical Bioinformatics

* usage of gene expression profiling
* multiple testing correction
* parameters for hierarchical clustering
* statistical evidence for a change in the mean
* dimensionality reduction
* central limit theorem
* hierarchical clustering
* clustering coefficient

<!--
#### Bioinformatics tools: Statistics & Graphics in R & BioConductor

* What is tidy data?
* ideas behind ggplot:  components of a ggplot, arrangement of input data ... (no actual code writing needed)
*  interpret common types of plots, e.g. barplot, boxplot, histogram
* effect of data transformation (e.g. log) on common types of plots
-->

#### Regulatory Genomics and Epigenomics
