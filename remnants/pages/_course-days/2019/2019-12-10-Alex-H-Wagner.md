## Clinical Interpretation Knowledgebases
### (I) Clinical Interpretation Knowledgebases and (II) Learning Bioinformatics
#### Alex H. Wagner

<!--more-->

The lecture will present challenges from the nee to interpret genome variants
in the context of "Precision Medicine", with regards of their diagnostic and 
therapeutic implications. The main focus of the lecture will be "Precision 
Oncology", and how new concepts in resource aggregation, open and participatory 
annotation models, "crowd" sourcing and knowledge ecosystem integration as well 
as computational tools and APIs can overcome the limitations of singular 
resources.

Another part of the lecture will touch upon the problem of ambiguous variant 
representations and how a new "Genomic Knowledge Standards" effort of the Global 
Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org)) attempts to solve 
this problem.

A second short lecture will focus on the keys to advancing your bioinformatics
knowledge and skills beyond this course. Pragmatic advice, common tools, and 
learning resources are discussed.


## Genome Data & Privacy
#### Michael Baudis

The understanding of the impact of individual inherited and somatic genome 
variants on phenotypes and diseases requires a thorough understanding of the 
occurrence of such variants amongst populations in general and carriers of the 
phenotypes and diseases in particular. This information can only be provided 
through the inclusion of data from a multitude of international genome resources 
in variant evaluation efforts. However, opening such resources carries the 
inherent risk of breaching privacy, particularly through re-identification of 
individuals or their relatives.

On the other hand, direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing has found widespread use 
with millions of individuals depositing some kind of genotyping data in open 
or closed repositories, facilitation "long-range re-identification attacks" 
against individuals through identification of their relatives. And new DNA 
analysis techniques enable sequencing without the need for expensive equipment 
or high-tech laboratories.

However, any risk evaluations regarding potential harm from genomic data (ab)use
have to be performed in the context of existing risks and changing attitudes, 
e.g. the widespread, willing exposure of private and possibly compromising data 
through social media platforms.
